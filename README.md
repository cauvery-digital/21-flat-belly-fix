The error message "[NODE-CRON] [ERROR] Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'deleteMany') TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'deleteMany')" indicates that a deleteMany function is being called on an object that is undefined. This typically occurs in Node.js applications when attempting to interact with a database, often MongoDB, and the database connection or a specific collection/model object is not properly initialized or available when the deleteMany operation is attempted.

Possible causes and solutions:

**• Asynchronous Database Connection:** The most common reason for this error is trying to perform database operations before the database connection has been fully established. Database connections are asynchronous, meaning they take time to complete.

 **• Solution:** Ensure that the code attempting to call deleteMany is executed only after the database connection has been successfully established. This often involves using async/await with the database connection function and then performing database operations within the then block of a promise or after await resolves. 

```javascript
    // Example (MongoDB with Mongoose)
    const mongoose = require('mongoose');
    const MyModel = require('./models/MyModel'); // Assuming you have a Mongoose model

    async function connectAndPerformDelete() {
        try {
            await mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase');
            console.log('Connected to database');

            // Now, safely perform deleteMany
            await MyModel.deleteMany({});
            console.log('Documents deleted successfully');

        } catch (error) {
            console.error('Database error:', error);
        } finally {
            mongoose.disconnect(); // Disconnect after operations (optional)
        }
    }

    connectAndPerformDelete();
```

## or

```javascript
// In your cron job file (e.g., cronJob.js)
const cron = require('node-cron');
const connectDatabase = require("../config/connectDatabase"); // Import your database connection function
const User = require('./models/usersModel'); // Import your Mongoose model


// Connect to the database once when the application starts
connectDatabase();

cron.schedule('* * * * *', async () => { // Example: runs every minute
  try {
    // Ensure YourModel is properly defined and accessible
    const result = await User.deleteMany({}); // Delete all documents
    console.log(`Deleted ${result.deletedCount} documents.`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('[NODE-CRON] [ERROR]', error);
  }
});

```

**• Uninitialized Database Object or Model:** The variable or object representing the database instance or the specific collection/model might not have been correctly initialized or assigned.

 **• Solution:** Verify that the variable holding the database connection object (e.g., db in a raw MongoDB driver context) or the Mongoose model is properly defined and accessible in the scope where deleteMany is called. 

**• Incorrect Scope or Export:** If the database connection or model is defined in a separate module, ensure it is correctly exported and imported into the file where the node-cron job is attempting to perform the deleteMany operation.

 **• Solution:** Double-check module.exports in the database connection file and require() or import statements in the cron job file. 

**• Database Not Running:** Although less likely to cause an "undefined" error directly, if the database server itself is not running, the connection will fail, which can indirectly lead to uninitialized database objects.

 **• Solution:** Confirm that your database server (e.g., MongoDB) is running and accessible.
